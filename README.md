# Bank-Data-Visualizations
This project focuses on analyzing Banking Data  and turning it into  actionable insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard  
## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of three tables that together provide a comprehensive view of customers and their financial behavior:

1. **Users Data** – Customer profile information:  
   - Age, gender, income, debt, credit score, number of credit cards, address, etc.  

2. **Cards Data** – Credit/debit card details:  
   - Brand (Visa, MasterCard…), type (Debit, Credit, Prepaid), chip availability, credit limit, number of issued cards, expiry date, etc.  

3. **Transactions Data** – Customer transaction records:  
   - Transaction ID, date, amount, merchant details (city, state, MCC), chip usage, errors, etc.
## 🛠️ Steps & Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Removed duplicates and invalid records  
   - Handled missing values and inconsistent formats 
2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created new calculated columns ( debt-to-income ratio, age groups, seasonal spending categories , etc)  
   - Derived additional attributes for segmentation and risk analysis  

3. **Aggregation & Measures**  
   - Built Power BI measures for KPIs such as average income, debt ratio, active customers, and transaction error rates  
   - Aggregated transaction data by season, merchant category, and channel (online/onsite)  

4. **Dashboard Creation**  
   - Designed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that allows filtering by customer, state, card type, and transaction channel  

  ## 🔎 Value of the Project

- Enables banks to **make data-driven decisions** instead of relying on assumptions  
- Enhances **customer experience** by understanding behavior more deeply  
- Reduces **risks** by identifying transaction errors and patterns of fraud

## This project was originally developed during the **DataDrip Hackathon – Qafza**, where it ranked among the **Top 30 projects**.
